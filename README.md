#### Complementary software to [*Hollow*](https://github.com/boscoh/hollow).


## Google Colab [![Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/unizar-flav/hollow-plus/blob/master/hollow.ipynb)

A Jupyter Notebook adapted to run *Hollow* in Google Colab can be found [here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/unizar-flav/hollow-plus/blob/master/hollow.ipynb).  
Run each cell in order, with special attention to the first one that only is needed to be executed once.
